excerpt: All done with year one!

We made it! All done!! And it was good.

A friend told me once that if I ever decided to start teaching, I'd have to go into it expecting to fail at first. Maybe not fail completely, but expecting it to be hard on me (the teacher). And he told me I'd have to be flexible and keep analyzing the classroom vibe, be willing to adapt quickly to the situation. 

I like to think I've been doing that this year.

I've already posted some of my [Lessons Learned](./2021-02-17-first-year-robotics-lessons-learned.md) as an attempt to think through -- to grok -- the whole classroom experience. It was challenging and I kept playing catch up to where the students needed me to be.

Now I'm declaring success. :hallelujah: It was a good year. The students did a good job flexing with me as we went through some growing pains together. The technology did fail us at times -- whatevs. We had a few classes in which some of students, for a variety of reasons, didn't have anything to really work on. And we had the inevitable situation with some students losing motivation and focus and just showing up with no intention to try. These things happen; no problem.

Here's the complete [guide to our robot vehicle](https://www.aerosci.dev/ccr_robotics_fall_2020). I wrote modules and how-to guides for each of the robot vehicle build steps. (Yes, I leaned heavily on other published, online works.) Take a look.

And, hey, I'm signed up to teach the 21-22 school year! Let's try again (with some hopes of a slightly smoother result!).
