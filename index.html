<a name="who-am-i" class="anchor" href="#who-am-i"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who Am I?</h3>

<p>I'm an Aerospace Engineer with a Bachelor's & Master's from the <a href="http://www.aero.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a> in the USA. I'm also a software developer. While I did't get a rigorous software engineering degree, I've studied the discipline "along the way" and have plenty of experience in aerospace-related simulations & beyond. </p>

<a name="what-am-i-doing" class="anchor" href="#what-am-i-doing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Am I Doing?</h3>

<p>My interest is in the space define by the intersection of aerospace engineering and software engineering. I 
like aerospace topics and I like software-driven scientific experimentation. Fortunately, there's a lot that fits into that region.

<p>I'm always interested in new problems to solve and new things to simulate. If you have an idea and think I can help, let me know.</p>
<p>Recently, I've been thinking a lot about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_management_system">Flight Management Systems</a> (FMS) and how they could be used for UAV systems. I have
some professional experience with FMS and suspect these kinds of systems could be re-imagined to provide a lot of strategic advantage to 
UAV users.
</p>
<p>Aside from that, I enjoy control theory topics like this <a href="https://github.com/buffetboy2001/Control-Component-Library">component library</a>, engaging other simulation frameworks like <a href="http://www.opensourcephysics.org/">OpenSourcePhysics</a>, <a href="https://github.com/buffetboy2001/InvertedPendulumControlExample">ODE propagation</a>, and working on <a href="https://github.com/buffetboy2001/model-argument-switching">interesting problems</a> in scientific software design.</p>

<a name="why-buffetboy2001" class="anchor" href="#why-buffetboy2001"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why buffetboy2001?</h3>
<p>Sure, it's a little silly. The prefix, buffetboy, comes from a nickname I received in college. I went to buffets. A lot. Chinese ones. Yup. And the number? Well, buffetboy was too generic by itself.</p>
