Stuff I've worked on -- Yay! I'll continue to add content here as I work on things that I want to highlight.

## Professional

I'm a proud technical staff employee of the [MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org), working on aviation research challenges. I've been involved in two major efforts in my professional life that I'm proud to have participated in. And, that work has produced important open-source code for the civil aviation community. Take a look if you're so inclined.

### FIM MOPS Aircraft & Control Model

**Link**: [https://mitre.github.io/FMACM/](https://mitre.github.io/FMACM/)

**Purpose**: A basic civil aviation simulation that contains standard 3-DOF equations of motion, and basic control laws for a guidance path. This code is used by avionics manufacturers when testing for compliance to RTCA minimum operational standard [DO-361A](https://my.rtca.org/NC__Product?id=a1B1R00000BdQlmUAF). The underlying model for FMACM is documented in this [MITRE technical paper](https://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/derivation-of-a-point-mass-aircraft-model-used-for-fast-time), written by a colleague. The simulation is a core but does contain missing parts that users must supply themselves. See the documentation.

### Interval Management Sample Algorithm

**Link**: [https://mitre.github.io/im_sample_algorithm/](https://mitre.github.io/im_sample_algorithm/)

**Purpose**: A minimum "sample" implementation of the algorithms necessary to comply with [DO-361A](https://my.rtca.org/NC__Product?id=a1B1R00000BdQlmUAF). This is used as a reference by manufacturers seeking to implement Interval Management concepts in the Flight-deck. 

## Personal

One of my personal delights has been to lead a Robotics class for high-schoolers at a local hybrid school. I keep all of my course materials in GitHub repos, because **#sharingisnice**
